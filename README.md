"# ConservationCourse" 

This project is comes from an idea for an non-governmental organization with the purpose to protect and promote tangible and intangible cultural heritage and develop innovative educational projects, ideas and prototypes combining technology and cultural heritage for the public and cultural sectors. During Hackership I created a 3D e-learning environment that allows a hands-on interaction with ancient cultural artefacts. The idea is to teach students conservation techniques for archaeological materials by presenting a virtual online class using the leap motion controller.

Requirements:

Unity3D
