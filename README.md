# Hands on conservation with Leap Motion Controllers

3D e-learning environment that allows a hands-on interaction with ancient cultural artefacts. The idea is to teach students conservation techniques for archaeological materials by presenting a virtual online class using the leap motion controller.

This a prototype was prepared for a course teaching conservation techniques to people who may not have access to the tools and resources available to professionals in the field. The course makes use of the Leap Motion hand tracking controller, which allows students to actually interact with tools and artefacts in a realistic virtual environment using the same natural gestures they would use in the lab.

The goal of this project is to teach these techniques to people in conflict areas, who may have no other means of learning appropriate methods of conservation and restoration, so that they can preserve and protect their own heritage.

Many thanks to Hackership Berlin for supporting this project!
